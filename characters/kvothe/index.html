    Kvothe is the main character in the Kingkiller Chronicle. He is the son of <a href="/characters/arliden/">Arliden</a> and <a href="/characters/laurian/">Laurian</a> and is a member of the Edema Ruh.
</p>

<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element">
	<div class="wpb_wrapper">
		<blockquote>
			<p>He called himself Kote. He had chosen the name carefully when he came to this place.</p>
			<p><strong>– Kote</strong> </p>
		</blockquote>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
    Kvothe was born to Arliden and Laurian, leaders of an Edema Ruh troupe under the patronage of Baron Greyfallow. His early education is spotty and eclectic, his teachers being troupers and travellers. This changes when his troupe picks up an arcanist named Abenthy.
</p>

<p>
    Meeting Abenthy was a pivotal moment in Kvothe's life. During his first encounter with the arcanist, he witnesses him call the name of the wind. This ability sparks his interest and ultimately leads him to the University. Abenthy instructs Kvothe in Sympathy, Chemistry, Rhetoric, and Arithmetic, in preparation for his admittance to the University. Abenthy eventually leaves the troupe, much to Kvothe's dismay.
</p>

<p>
    After Abenthy's departure, Kvothe's eclectic education with the troupe is stepped up to keep him busy. Not long later his troupe is brutally murdered by the Chandrian, Kvothe escapes because he is playing in the forest away from the road. When he returns, he has a brief encounter with the Chandrian until they suddenly leave, seeming to flee discovery from some unseen presence.
</p>

<p>
    After the horrific discovery of his slaughtered family, and subsequent encounter with Cinder and Haliax, the traumatized Kvothe flees into the nearby woods with nothing but his father's lute. He then spends nearly half a year recovering, completely alone. It is during this time he learns to play the lute so well, he can conjure up specific feelings and images with the notes. He is eventually forced to leave the forest when too many of his lute strings break. After days of walking, and a little help from a humble farmer named Seth, he reaches Tarbean.
</p>

<h2>Tarbean</h2>

<p>
    On Kvothe's first day in Tarbean, a group of street urchins led by a boy named Pike rob and beat him, destroying his father's lute in the process. After this incident, he decides to go home with Seth, but in his effort to find the farmer he becomes lost in the city, missing his chance. Over the next three years, he is forced to beg and steal simply to survive. He eventually finds a well-hidden shelter where three roofs meet above Tarbean's candle works, which provides Kvothe some warmth and a place to store his meager possessions during his stay in the city.
</p>

<p>
    Here Kvothe develops an identity as a street urchin, learning most of his lessons the hard way. Once while begging in Hillside, a relatively upscale neighborhood, he is caught by a guardsman and beaten within an inch of his life. He is saved from hypothermia by a man, Gerrek, acting the part of Encanis in the Midwinter Pageant. Shortly thereafter, Kvothe becomes terribly ill and seeks the help of Trapis, a man who cares for the discarded and otherwise helpless children of Tarbean. Trapis tells the story of Tehlu and Encanis, the first of many tales that will guide Kvothe on the Chandrian's trail. After he is well again, Kvothe becomes very fond of Trapis, often visiting to assist him and work for food.
</p>

<p>
    A year before his departure from Tarbean, Kvothe locates Pike, the boy who destroyed his father's lute and stalks him back to where he has made his home in an alley. Kvothe observes the young man and finds that he has a stash of sentimental personal belongings. Later, when the boy leaves his shelter, Kvothe steals down into it and destroys everything. He relishes so long in the destruction that Pike catches him, but he manages to escape. He subsequently avoids Dockside where Pike and his friends roam, until he hears of a storyteller.
</p>

<p>
    Shortly before his departure from Tarbean, he hears of Skarpi, a storyteller who can be found at The Half Mast, a bar in Dockside. It is rumored that Skarpi has an open wager to any person who can request a story he does not know. Wishing to hear the story of Lanre, Kvothe decides to pay a visit to the bar. After Skarpi tells the story, Kvothe has a short meeting with the man where he agrees to return the following night. However, Kvothe arrives late and comes in during the story of Myr Tariniel. Shortly thereafter Skarpi is arrested for blasphemy and he makes no further appearances in the story. After this occurrence Kvothe decides to leave Tarbean and seek admittance to the University. He proceeds to sell what little he has, including his book Rhetoric and Logic, a gift from Abenthy. He retains a receipt for the book so he might purchase it back someday. He then bids farewell to Trapis and secures a place on a caravan led by Roent. While traveling in the caravan he meets Denna for the first time.
</p>

<h2>The University</h2>
<p>
    Kvothe is accepted into the University, and manages to enter the Arcanum within three days. He is reunited with Denna, visits Trebon in search of the Chandrian, is raised to Re'lar, and is brought up against the iron law.
</p>

<h3>First Term (Spring)</h3>
<p>
    Kvothe gains admission to the University under virtually unheard-of circumstances, gaining a scholarship of minus three talents (he negotiates being given money to attend) at the young age of fifteen. He is among the youngest students to have ever attended the institution. He meets Simmon, Wilem, Manet, and Sovoy shortly after admissions, becoming fast friends with the group. In his first class, Principles of Sympathy, he finds the course far below his ability level. At the end of the class, he attempts to explain this to Master Hemme but is summarily dismissed. The following day, Hemme attempts to embarrass Kvothe by insisting that he teach the class. Kvothe quickly turns the tables by displaying his prowess as an arcanist, burning Hemme's foot in the process. This leads to Kvothe's first run-in with the University's disciplinary procedure when he is charged with unauthorized use of sympathy and malfeasance. When the circumstances of his actions are uncovered, however, he is spared expulsion and instead receives three lashes as punishment. Surprisingly, he is then granted access to the Arcanum, as he has proven his skill in sympathy by performing a double binding. He is sponsored to E'lir by Master Kilvin and, in exchange, Kvothe begins his study in artificing. Kvothe is publicly whipped, gaining notoriety by neither screaming nor even bleeding. He then goes to the medica for treatment, where he meets Master Arwyl, who invites him to study there. Artificing and medicine become Kvothe's focus for the remainder of the term.
</p>
<p>
    Kvothe is immediately drawn to the University's Archives, where he asks the scrivs at the Tomes for texts on the Chandrian and the Amyr－despite Master Lorren's discouragement against this line of inquiry. When he gains promotion to the Arcanum and can finally research the subject on his own, his quest is again cut short by Ambrose Jakis, who tricks him into entering the stacks with an open flame. The resulting banishment lasts several terms, though Kvothe manages to regain access much earlier when Auri helps him discover a secret entrance through the Underthing.
</p>
<p>
    Fascinated by his abilities as Master Namer and curious of his unconventional nature, Kvothe seeks the company and advice of Master Elodin. Elodin then takes him to Haven to show him the potential hazards of studying Naming. Here Elodin instructs Kvothe to jump off the roof, which he does, thinking Elodin will break his fall by calling the wind. Elodin does not, and instead tells Kvothe that he is too impulsive to study under him. Crestfallen and bruised, Kvothe decides to focus on his Artificing for the time being.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Second Term (Summer)</h3>
<p>
    In order to pay tuition for his second term, Kvothe seeks out a gaelet and finds Devi, who gives him the first of several loans he will eventually take from her. She uses her clients' blood as collateral if they have nothing of value. Kvothe resists at first but eventually agrees to it out of desperation. With money to his own name for the first time, he pays his admission and purchases his first lute since his father's was broken in Tarbean.
</p>
<p>
    Kvothe studies sygaldry under Kilvin's giller, Cammar, impressing him by learning the basics in just seven days, rather than the whole term that most students require. He achieves this largely by setting all one hundred ninety-seven runes to music that he can mentally reference with ease. He is then apprenticed to Manet.
</p>
<p>
    His other studies included the medicine, mathematics, and advanced sympathy with Elxa Dal. His schedule eventually begins to wear on him, and around the fifth span he begins to burn out. He remains undefeated in sympathetic dueling, but Wilem and Simmon speak to Kilvin and have him banned from working extra hours in the shop to save him from total exhaustion.
</p>
<p>
    With a spot of extra time in his schedule, Kvothe decides to look into playing at the Eolian. While practicing in a quiet, secluded courtyard, he gradually befriends a timid young girl who lives beneath the University in a network of tunnels and caverns she calls the Underthing. Kvothe names her Auri and generally keeps their relationship and meetings secret. Wilem and Simmon accompany Kvothe to the Eolian when he decides to try for his talent pipes. He plays "The Lay of Sir Savien Traliard", a very difficult song which requires a female accompaniment. He hopes that amongst the talented performers in the Eolian, one will step up and sing the harmony when the time comes. After a tense moment of hesitation, a voice rises out of the crowd, and the song goes wonderfully, despite (or partly because of) the fact that a string breaks on his lute during the performance. He wins his talent pipes, figures out that Ambrose used sympathy to break his lute string (giving himself binder's chills in the process and leaving as soon as the performance was over), and discovers after much searching that Denna was the woman to step in and sing the Aloine harmony in the song. She is at the Eolian with Sovoy, going by the name of Dianne.
</p>
<p>
    During admissions week, he makes an arrangement to be a house musician at the Horse and Four. Here, Kvothe and Count Threpe write "Jackass, Jackass", a jeering play on Ambrose's last name, and perform it at the Eolian. With the proceeds, Kvothe buys back his copy of Rhetoric and Logic from Master Lorren, and tries unsuccessfully to get his ban from the Archives rescinded. Ambrose charges Kvothe with Conduct Unbecoming a Member of the Arcanum over the song, but the Masters replace the charge with Undignified Mischief. Three days later, the Horse and Four is sold to a new owner who tells Kvothe that he is no longer needed. It seems that Ambrose has arranged the sale and threatened other nearby inns against hiring Kvothe. Anker, partly because he needs a musician and partly just to thumb his nose at Ambrose, takes Kvothe in, giving him a small room and access to meals in exchange for playing four nights a span.
</p>
<p>
    Kvothe finishes the term "not quite sixteen" years old.
</p>

<h3>Third Term (Fall)</h3>
<p>
    To allow time for his music, Kvothe limits himself to three fields of study: Advanced Sympathy, a shift in the Medica, and his artificing apprenticeship.
</p>
<p>
    Denna returns to town and finds Kvothe at Anker's. They go for a six-hour walk, and the next day she vanishes again, leaving her bill unpaid at the Oaken Oar, where she had been using the name Dinnah.
</p>
<p>
    Manet accidentally reveals that there is a secret way to the Archives, but will reveal no more to his young apprentice. Kvothe rises to journeyman by making a bulls-eye sympathy lamp, which Master Kilvin admonishes as a "thieves lamp". It was skillfully made, however, and Kvothe is allowed to keep it as long as he swears that it never falls into another's possession. 
</p>
<p>
    Denna returns and meets Simmon and Wilem at the Eolian. They spend the evening in one another's company and make plans to meet the following day.
</p>
<p>
    The next morning, Kvothe saves Fela from a bone-tar fire in the Fishery and misses his appointment with Denna. He is so poor he cannot afford to replace the clothes damaged in the fire until some of his work at the Fishery sells, and then he can only buy some used boots. He sees Fela at the Eolian and she gives him a fine new cloak in thanks for saving her from the fire, declaring herself indebted to him. He briefly spots Denna leaving, and worries that she will think he spurned her for Fela, but he does not pursue her.
</p>
<p>
    Two thugs armed with a "finder"—a sympathetic compass that uses a hair to point toward its owner—hunt Kvothe down in an alley in Imre and attempt to kill him. He manages to use sympathy to blind and stun them long enough to escape, adding to his reputation, as they believe he called down fire and lightning on them. Later, crawling into his room through the window, he finds a note Denna left for him wedged into the window frame several days prior. In it, she hints at having met someone interesting about whom she wishes to speak to Kvothe. He takes steps to confound the "finder" in case someone else comes after him, and takes a room in an inn near the docks.
</p>
<p>
    The following day, he hears about a wedding near Trebon, where it seems the Chandrian appeared and killed everyone. He borrows more money from Devi, buys a horse, and rides sixty miles in half a day to reach the town. On the way, he comes across a tinker to whom he trades away the horse for a loden-stone and sundry other items. At the local inn, he inquires about the wedding, hoping to glean information about the Chandrian, and discovers that there was one survivor, slightly injured, who turns out to be Denna.
</p>
<p>
    The two of them leave the inn and head towards the Mauthen Farm to see if Denna can find any of her things from before she was knocked unconscious. She tells him about her eccentric potential patron, and Kvothe nicknames him Master Ash. They look around the farm, and Denna tells Kvothe that she saw blue flame during the chaos. What wood remains is rotted, and the iron pump-handle is rusted through—signs that the Chandrian were indeed involved.
</p>
<p>
    Denna wants to go looking for Master Ash, so they head into the woods to explore. Eventually, they run across Skoivan Schiemmelpfenneg ("Schiem"), a swineherd with whom they share dinner and a local legend around blue flame in the bluffs to the north. They head in that direction and camp at the top of a hill with a good view of the bluffs, littered with a handful of greystones. Kvothe theorizes that Mauthen dug up a Chandrian artifact of some kind when building his house, and that is what attracted them. They see the blue flame to the north before bedding down for the night.
</p>
<p>
    A draccus wakes them in the middle of the night, as it comes to the hilltop lured by their fire. It destroys the fire and eventually leaves in the early morning. Kvothe and Denna make it to where they saw a small plume of smoke rising, and find a small, curious encampment. The draccus appears, and they flee into a cave, where Kvothe realizes that it is a grove of denner trees being cultivated to make ophalum—but not before Denna chews a large amount of it, thinking it to be maple candy. Kvothe tries to help treat her for the drug's effects but hasn't much to work with. They collect all the ophalum they can find, hoping to sell it back in Imre or the University. In the meantime, he realizes that the draccus is addicted to the resin of the Denner trees and has become dangerous. They decide to try to overdose it with some of the resin. They ball up two-thirds of the resin they found and bait the draccus with a fire, then hide to wait for it to arrive. It does so, takes the bait, and starts to fall asleep. Then, fires from Trebon's harvest festival attract its attention and it races maniacally toward the town. Kvothe must leave Denna, who has passed out from the ophalum, to race after the draccus, following it into Trebon. With the last of the ophalum as bait, he manages to save part of the town from the fire with some sygaldry and sympathy, killing it with a massive iron wheel and knocking himself out in the process. 
</p>
<p>
    When Kvothe awakens, the townsfolk are in awe, unable to understand what happened. They tell him that they have "disposed of the demon" in the proper manner, and Kvothe plays on their bemusement to gather further information about the events of the wedding. Nina tells him that she saw the artifact the Mauthens dug up and that it was a vase or urn with drawings on it. When she describes what she remembered, Kvothe knows the drawings were of the Chandrian. She is terrified, and Kvothe gives her an amulet that he claims he has charmed to protect her. He then leaves Trebon, unable to find Denna since the night of the draccus.
</p>

    Back at the University, Ambrose steals Kvothe's lute from its case. While toying with it to tease Kvothe, he carelessly breaks it. Enraged, Kvothe involuntarily calls the name of the wind and buffets Ambrose, breaking his arm. Kvothe then falls into a trancelike state. Elodin finds him and whispers something that begins to mend him psychologically.
</p>
<p>
    Ambrose and Kvothe are brought before the horns (the disciplinary council). Ambrose is found guilty of stealing and destroying Kvothe's lute and required to pay for its replacement. Kvothe is found guilty of malfeasance and sentenced to six lashes and expulsion, but his expulsion is immediately repealed at Elodin's behest. Kvothe is then raised to Re'lar with Elodin as his sponsor, the second time his status is elevated after punishment.
</p>
<p>
    Kvothe's lashing proceeds in much the same way as his first, and he purchases a new lute and other small things with Ambrose's money.
</p>
<p>
    It's during this time that Auri begins to show Kvothe around the Underthing. Auri eventually leads Kvothe to a passage that he discovers leads to the Archives, a system of tunnels that provide ventilation for the myriad books.
</p>
<h3>Fourth Term (Fall)</h3>
<p>
    During this term, Kvothe is poisoned with a plum bob, breaks into Ambrose's rooms, builds a Gram, creates his first original work in the Fishery and pines for Denna.
